# I'm at my limit!

$$
\lim_{x \to p}{f(x)}=L \iff \left( \forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0: \forall x \in \R, 0 < \lvert x - p \rvert < \delta \implies \lvert f(x) - L \rvert < \epsilon \right)
$$

If you're telling me that the limit of $f(x)$ is $L$ as $x$ approaches $p$, then what you're saying is that I can give
you some number, $\epsilon$, which defines a range above and below $L$ ($L \pm \epsilon$ if you'd like to think of it
that way). Now, your job is to take $\epsilon$, and give me some other number, $\delta$. If I take your $\delta$ and
look within the range $p \pm \delta$, then any (defined) value I come up with in that range will give me a value inside
the range $L \pm \epsilon$.

So it's kind of like a game[^1]. You claim that the limit is $L$. I give you some arbitrarily small range around $L$.
You give me another range around $p$, and if I pick any value $x \in \R$ in that range where $f(x)$ is defined, then
I'll get a value that's within _my_ range around $L$. And I can do this any number of times. I can keep giving you
progressively smaller values for $\epsilon$, but the $\delta$ you give me will always produce values in the range around
$L$.
