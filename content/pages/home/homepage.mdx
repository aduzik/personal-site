<h1 className="text-7xl">Hi, I'm Alex</h1>

I design software systems that solve today's problems and are ready to adapt for tomorrow's.

I work in the place where structure, constraints, and long-term evolution matter. I shape systems so that they remain
comprehensible, adaptable, and correct as they grow.

That means learning the lay of the land first: understanding problems, untangling complexity, and finding an approach
that leads to a well-tailored, straightforward, sensible implementation.

I'm a problem solver by nature. I love working with problems that have ambiguous requirements, weird constraints, and no
obvious solutions. I think this is where careful thinking, strong collaboration, and good design make all the
difference. I approach problems with curiosity, and I see every project as an opportunity to learn and improve.

# Depth informs design

My work spans many layers of abstraction.

I've driven enterprise-wide architectural evolutions. I've built language tooling, parsers, and compilers. I've designed
backend services and APIs. I've built frontend component libraries. I've worked on systems that needed to be both
flexible and predictable over long periods of time.

I've found that engaging with systems at the lowest levels is essential to designing them well at the high level.

# My prime directive

> Write code for people first, computers second.

This is the core of my software development ethos. Code is never static. It evolves because the world evolves. It gets
read, modified, extended, [folded, spindled, and mutilated][punch-card]. Good design embraces that reality and positions
systems so that they readily and eagerly adapt to change.

# This site

This is where I write about software design, architecture, languages, tooling, and the technical problems that get me
out of the bed in the morning.

I write [articles](/articles), which is my fussy word for "blog posts", where I do my thinking in public.

# Are you building something interesting?

I love to work with people and organizations whose problem domain demands thoughtful design and architectural clarity.
The right leverage in the right place can move mountains. If that resonates with you, feel free to
